<center>Microsatellite Instability States Serve as Predictive Biomarkers for Tumours Chemotherapy Sensitivity

## Summary

Background: Chemotherapy is the most effective treatment for advanced tumours, but there is an urgent need for markers to predict the efficacy of different drugs. Herein, we examined whether microsatellite instability (MSI) status, which is widely used to phenotype cancers, can predict tumour multidrug sensitivity and explored the underlying mechanisms. 

 

Methods: We downloaded data from several public databases, extracted IC50 values for chemotherapeutic drugs, and performed bioinformatics-based prediction of chemosensitivity. Drug sensitivity was compared between the high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) and microsatellite-stable/low microsatellite instability (MSS/MSI-L) groups. In addition, we performed pathway enrichment analysis and cellular chemosensitivity assays to explore the mechanisms by which MSI status may affect drug sensitivity and assessed the differences between drug-treated and control cell lines.

 

Results: Multiple MSI-H tumours were more sensitive to a variety of chemotherapy drugs than MSS/MSI-L tumours. Mechanistic studies have shown that DNA damage repair (DDR) pathways, especially the nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway in colorectal cancer (CRC), play an important role in the high drug sensitivity of many tumours mediated by MSI-H status. Interestingly, NHEJ is also a protective factor in terms of CRC patient prognosis. In addition, studies of colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) cell lines after drug treatment showed that chemotherapeutic drugs could inhibit DDR pathways such as NHEJ, further increasing drug sensitivity. 

 

Conclusion: For a variety of MSI-H tumours, especially CRC, chemosensitivity is enhanced through the downregulation of DDR pathways such as NHEJ. Additional DNA damage caused by chemotherapeutic drugs results in further downregulation of DDR pathways and enhances drug sensitivity, forming a cycle of increasing drug sensitivity.
